  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <article>
    <p>Hi! My name is Kaleb. Originally from <a href="https://www.google.com/maps?q=cottage+grove+mn&es_sm=93&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=X&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAWoVChMI-q6k7ND0xwIVhgWSCh1YTw8h">Cottage Grove, MN</a>, I am a senior at <a href="http://www.luther.edu/">Luther College</a> where I am completing a major in management and a minor in computer science.
    With this combination of studies I hope to pursue a career in IT management.  
    I am a huge fan of the Minnesota Twins and enjoy watching games both on television and at Target Field during the summer. Also, I have been an amateur genealogist for several years and have traced my family tree back five generations. Other interests include classic films and television, 
    card games and board games, and camping with my family.
