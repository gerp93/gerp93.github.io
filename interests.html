            I am a huge fan of the Minnesota Twins and enjoy watching games both on television and at Target Field during the summer. Also, I have been an amateur genealogist for several years and have traced my family tree back five generations. Other interests include classic films and television, 
    card games and board games, and camping with my family.
        In my spare time I enjoy listening to music.  These are some of my favorite bands:
        <ul>
          <li>Queen</li>
          <li>The Eagles</li>
          <li>Dire Straits</li>
          <li>REO Speedwagon</li>
        </ul>
